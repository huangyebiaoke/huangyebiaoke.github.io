	As an old saying goes: An idol is an example to advise you what should do and what should not do.everyone has
their own idol.Maybe actor singer or other famous people.
	My idol is Obama--the first African American to have served as the 44th President of the United States.He is so 
humorous,wise and farsighted.He is so glamour that attract me to look forward with him.
<!--more-->
	As a president,he did so many great for America.The first thing he did is promote the establishment of a world 
without nuclear weapons in 2009.The second thing is killed BenLaden--the biggest terrorist.without Obama's order,who care you live or die.The third event occur in 2008--the global financial crisis.The president Obama saved America,again.
	As a husband,he love his wife Michele so much,no somking no drinking and no whoring.As a father,he also pay 
withhis daughter whenever how busy he is.
	Oboma is so great person that's why I like him.
